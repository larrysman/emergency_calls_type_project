## The prediction of the next emergency_calls_type_project
 - The project aimed at studying the various reasons for making emergency calls over a given period with the reference case to the 911 calls. 
 - I built neural network models to predict the next emergency calls type and evaluate the performance. 
 - I also built a stochastic models using Logistic Regression and RandomForestClassifier to provide bases for comparison of the best performing algorithms.

 - From the exporatory data analysis carried out, it is right to conclude that the highest calls by reason is the `EMS` and most of these calls happend between 11th - 23rd of every month with 23rd having the highest records.
 - More of these calls are experienced in January, the year 2016.

 - For the fully connected network model, we can measure the accuracy of the model at 74.0%. Though, there is room to optimize this model for more robust performance.

###### Logistic Regression

![18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0b4dab2-d5bc-43db-b106-5f697423f18b)

 - This model performs at 67.80% accuracy and this model needs serious optimization to improve the performance.

###### Random Forest Classifier

![19](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0734024d-fb91-48c7-808c-dc6094a8c89b)

After carefully testing different algorithms in predicitng the next case of emergency, we could deduce that random forest classifier would be a better option with an accuracy of 86.30%.


## Collaboration:

For optimizing the model to provide great and robust performance, I am open for collaboration in fine-tunning to obtain optimality.

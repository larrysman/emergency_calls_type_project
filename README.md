# The prediction of the next emergency_calls_type_project
 - The project aimed at studying the various reasons for making emergency calls over a given period with the reference case to the 911 calls. 
 - I built neural network models to predict the next emergency calls type and evaluate the performance. 
 - I also built a stochastic models using Logistic Regression and RandomForestClassifier to provide bases for comparison of the best performing algorithms.
